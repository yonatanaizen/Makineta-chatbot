# Makineta-Chatbot
Welcome to the Makineta-Chatbot project! This application, developed across two main Python files, is designed to revolutionize how customers choose Makineta machines. It features a chatbot that assists users in selecting the perfect machine from the store, recommending options based on parameters such as type, cost, and number of users. This innovative chatbot functions in a conversational manner, akin to human interaction, thereby eliminating the need for direct, machine-like questions. With the help of PyInstaller, the app is also available in an executable (EXE) format.

### get_data 
In this file, I retrieve data from the website and convert it into a DataFrame. To accomplish this task, I utilize libraries such as Selenium, Pandas, and Time.

### app
This file is dedicated to building the GUI. It includes a function to tailor data to the user's needs and employs a custom string comparison approach to avoid key errors. The libraries used here include Tkinter and Pandas.
